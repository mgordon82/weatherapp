# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather App

I used yarn to install and maintain packages.

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

## Code Explanation

I am working on different variations of writing code. I primarily built the app in JSX. I am also varying what I use to style the components. Some have just an imported css file, some have inline styles, and I will be working on building styled components as well.

I am not using MUI for the layout and framework, just to show how I can write CSS to control layout. However, I do find that design libraries do save a ton of time in building applications.

## Tests

Testing is still in progress. I am having an issue getting Jest to cooperate and work in my application. I will be continuing to work on this.
